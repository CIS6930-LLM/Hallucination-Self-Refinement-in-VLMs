# Models

- `baselines/`: Checkpoints, configs, or notes from baseline systems (e.g., LLaVA 1.5, BLIP-2).
- `checkpoints/`: Saved weights for self-refinement models across phases (`v1`–`v4`).

Track actual model weights in remote storage; keep metadata or lightweight config files under version control.
