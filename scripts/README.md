# Scripts

- `data/`: Utilities for downloading, preprocessing, and synthetic data generation.
- `training/`: Entry points for baseline reproduction, rationale supervision, and RLAIF.
- `evaluation/`: CLI tools for running POPE/VQA benchmarks and exporting dashboard-ready metrics.
- `deployment/`: Optional endpoints or inference demos.

Place executable scripts or lightweight wrappers here; prefer Python entry points under `src/`.
