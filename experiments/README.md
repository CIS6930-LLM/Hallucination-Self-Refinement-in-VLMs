# Experiments

- `configs/`: YAML/JSON configuration files covering experiment variants (E1–E4, ablations, RLAIF).
- `logs/`: Training logs, tensorboard exports, and runtime metrics (ignored via `.gitignore`).
- `reports/`: Generated evaluation summaries and plots suitable for the dashboard.

Record every experiment with a short descriptor and link to data lineage to ease reproducibility.
